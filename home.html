      <h1>How can we redesign a public library website?</h1>

      <p class="text">Above is the current website for the Southborough Public Library, 
        a local library not too far from where I live. We can quickly see that it's on the older 
        side with plenty of scope for improvement. As someone who always loved going to 
        the local library when they were little, these old library websites are very 
        nostalgic for me. But what might they look like with a more modern design? To try to 
        answer this question, I first explored 
        problems with usability and accessibility. 
      </p>

      <div class="problems">
        <div class="problems-section">
          <h2 class="problems-header">Usability Issues</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Searching the catalog, which is one of the most common reasons for vising a library page, is not immediately accessible from the home page. The user
              has to first click on "Browse our Catalog"
            </li>
            <li>The text blocks and links feel very crowded. Clicking through a series of 
              small links is not very memorizable
            </li>
            <li>
              The images buttons on the right-hand side are old and grainy
            </li>
            <li>
              There are too many distractions and links throughout the page in addition to the main top menu bar. It 
              does not feel cohesive
            </li>
            <li>
              The row of books at the bottom of the screen also seems packed and distracting 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="problems-section">
          <h2 class="problems-header">Accessibility</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There are several empty links and areas with low contrast between the text and 
              background colors
            </li>
            <li>The screen reader reads through countless small icons which give
              minimal context to the user, but it is good that all the icons have alternative text
            </li>
            <li>
              The center section is a slideshow, with each slide having a lot of text. The page could
              change the current slide before the screen reader has finished reading it 
            </li>
            <li>
              There are a few redundant links 
            </li>
          </ul>

        

        </div>

      <p class="text">With these problems in mind, I started designing a new library website that 
        strove to be simpler in how it presented information to the user. I came up with the following 
        low-fi designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. I ended up removing a lot of 
        what I thought was "extraneous" information. I could definitely see that the original website designers 
        were trying to give as much helpful information as possible to the user, but it seemed to negatively impact 
        the UI, where the user might just want to quickly search the catalog. After all, we don't typically surf library websites!
      </p>

      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Desktop</h2>

        <h2>Tablet</h2>
        <img class="lofi-image" src="assets/tablet.png" alt="Tablet Lofi Design">

        <h2>Mobile</h2>
        <img class="lofi-image" src="assets/mobile.png" alt="Mobile Lofi Design">
      </div>

      <p class="text">These then led to the following corresponding high-fi designs.</p>
      
      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Desktop</h2>
        <img class="lofi-image" src="assets/highfi-desktop.png" alt="Desktop High-fi Design">
      </div>

      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Tablet</h2>
        <img class="lofi-image" src="assets/highfi-tablet.png" alt="Tablet High-fi Design">
      </div>

      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Mobile</h2>
        <img class="lofi-image" src="assets/highfi-mobile.png" alt="Mobile High-fi Design">
      </div>

      <p class="text">For the finished product, I came up with the following visual study guide:</p>
      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Visual Study Guide</h2>
        <img class="lofi-image" src="assets/visual-final.png" alt="Visual Study Guide">
      </div>

      <p class="text">Finally, I coded the redesigned website!</p>
      <a id="redesigned-url" href="southborough-library-v2.html">Redesigned Southborough Library Website</a>
      <p class="text">Here are a few screenshots of different screen sizes:</p>

      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Desktop</h2>
        <img id="final-desktop" class="lofi-image" src="assets/final-desktop.png" alt="Redesigned Desktop Image">
      </div>
      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Tablet</h2>
        <img id="final-tablet" class="lofi-image" src="assets/final-tablet.png" alt="Redesigned Tablet Image">
      </div>
      <div class="low-fi">
        <h2>Mobile</h2>
        <img id="final-mobile" class="lofi-image" src="assets/final-mobile.png" alt="Redesigned Mobile Image">
      </div>

      <p class="text">The new design seems to be easier to use in terms of 
        giving the user a simpler menu of likely actions they want to take. For any action not 
        immediately listed, the user can refer to the accordion menu on the left-hand side. The new 
        design successfully responds to different computer screens and 
        mobile devices. It uses a fewer number of and higher resolution images, and as a result 
        the screen reader needs to go through much less alternative text. </p>
        
      <p class="text">Compared to the original 
        website, the user needs to go through much less visual and accessible input in order to 
        understand the page. Most importantly, they can immediately find common information they are 
        looking for, such as when the library is open, if a certain book or online resource is available, or 
        if they want to reach out to the library directly.
